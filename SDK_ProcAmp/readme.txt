#Current Progress

The following steps have been completed:

- Altered `SDK_ProcAmpGPU` code to return the RGB values of the frame data.

##Purpose

The RGB data obtained from this process will not be used directly for training the model. Instead, it serves the purpose of understanding the format of the data. This understanding ensures a smooth transition when training and predicting with the object detection model.
